# An Awesome Guide

The default rc.lua file is well commented, but it may still be difficult to
read for new users. Learning the basics is a great way of understanding more
complicated concepts later.

I've been using Awesome for a year or two on and off. In that time I have tried
adding some of my own functionality. As long as I was making minor edits to the
existing rc.lua, such as creating my own table of tags instead of the default 1
through 9, this was reasonably successful. However, as soon as I tried to do
something a little more complicated such as making a new widget, everything
would fall apart. I found the existing documentation difficult to follow and I
wasn't sure where to start when trying to read & understand the existing Lua
modules.

I hope my experience and ongoing path to Awesome competence (I wouldn't call it
mastery at this point) will be helpful to other people.
